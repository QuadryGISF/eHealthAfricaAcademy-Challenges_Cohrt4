    <P><strong>EQUIPMENT</strong></P>
    <ul>
        <li>1 (10- to 12-inch) nonstick ovensafe frying pan or cast iron skillet</li>
        <li>Spatula</li>
        <li>Mandoline with hand guard (optional)</li>
        <li>Whisk</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p><strong>INSTRUCTIONS</strong></p>

    <p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Heat the oven.</strong> Arrange a rack in the middle of the oven and heat to 400°F.</li>
            <li><strong>Whisk the eggs and cream together.</strong> Whisk the eggs, heavy cream, and 1/2 teaspoon salt together in a small bowl; set aside.</li>
            <li><strong>Cook the bacon.</strong> Place the bacon in a cold 10- to 12-inch nonstick ovensafe frying pan or cast iron skillet, then turn the heat to medium-high. Cook the bacon, stirring occasionally, until crisp, 8 to 10 minutes. Remove the bacon with a slotted spoon to a paper towel-lined plate and pour off all but 2 tablespoons of the fat. (If omitting the bacon, heat 2 tablespoons oil in the skillet, then proceed with adding the potatoes).</li>
            <li><strong>Saute the potatoes in bacon fat.</strong> Return the pan to medium-heat, add the potatoes and sprinkle with the pepper and the remaining 1/2 teaspoon salt. Cook, stirring occasionally, until tender and lightly browned, 4 to 6 minutes.</li>
            <li><strong>Wilt the spinach with the garlic and thyme.</strong> Pile the spinach into the pan with the garlic and thyme, and cook, stirring, for 30 seconds to 1 minute or until spinach wilts. Add the bacon back to the pan and stir to evenly distribute.</li>
            <li><strong>Add the cheese.</strong> Spread the vegetables into an even layer, flattening with a spatula. Sprinkle the cheese on top and let it just start to melt.</li>
            <li><strong>Pour the egg mixture into the skillet.</strong> Pour the egg mixture over the vegetables and cheese. Tilt the pan to make sure the eggs settle evenly over all the vegetables. Cook for a minute or two until you see the eggs at the edges of the pan beginning to set.</li>
            <li><strong>Bake the frittata for 8 to 10 minutes.</strong> Bake until the eggs are set, 8 to 10 minutes. To check, cut a small slit in the center of the frittata. If raw eggs run into the cut, bake for another few minutes; if the eggs are set, pull the frittata from the oven. For a browned, crispy top, run the frittata under the broiler for a minute or two at the end of cooking.</li>
            <li><strong>Cool and serve.</strong> Cool in the pan for 5 minutes, then slice into wedges and serve.</li>

        </ol>

    <p><strong>INSTRUCTIONS</strong></p>

    <p>
        <ol>
            <li>Whisk the eggs until the whites and yolks are fully combined. Melt the butter in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Once melted, reduce heat to medium-low and pour in the eggs. Stir often until the eggs reach your desired level of softness. Remove from heat and stir in salt and pepper, then move to a big serving platter.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, warm the leftover vegetables in the microwave or in a skillet over low heat. Transfer the warmed vegetables to the serving platter with the eggs.</li>
            <li>To warm the tortillas on a gas stove, heat the remaining burners to medium to warm and toast the tortillas briefly on both sides. If you have an electric stove, select another method to heat the tortillas. Wrap the warm tortillas in a clean dish towel to keep them warm.</li>
            <li>Bring the platter of taco toppings to the table with the tortillas, cilantro, and hot sauce. Let everyone build their own tacos at the table.</li>

    <ul>

        <li>Large nonstick skillet</li>
        <li>Spatula</li>

    </ul>

    <P><strong>INSTRUCTIONS</strong></P>

    <p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Cut holes in the bread.</strong> Using a 2- to 2 1/2-inch round cutter (or the bottom of a small drinking glass), cut out the centers of 2 slices sandwich bread. Reserve the centers.</li>
            <li><strong>Melt the butter.</strong> Melt 3 tablespoons unsalted butter in a large nonstick skillet over medium-low heat. Swirl the pan as the butter melts to evenly coat the entire surface. You don’t want to brown the butter — just melt it. The pan is ready when the butter just starts to sizzle.</li>
            <li><strong>Toast the bread.</strong> Add the bread slices with the centers cut out, then nestle the bread rounds next to them. Cook until the bread is toasted and light golden-brown on the bottom, 3 to 4 minutes.</li>
            <li><strong>Add the eggs.</strong> Flip the slices and rounds over using a thin spatula. Crack 1 large egg into each hole. (It’s OK if some of the egg white seeps out from underneath the bread slice.) Season the eggs with kosher salt and several grinds of black pepper</li>
            <li><strong>Cook the eggs.</strong> Cover the pan and cook until the egg whites are fully set, the yolk is still runny, and the other side of the bread is golden-brown, 3 1/2 to 4 1/2 minutes. Check the eggs after 3 minutes: If the bread is not browning, increase the heat. For hard-cooked egg yolks, cook for 5 to 5 1/2 minutes instead.</li>
            <li><strong>Serve immediately.</strong> Transfer the toasts and the cut-out rounds to a plate. Garnish with chopped chives, if using, and serve immediately.</li>
            

        </ol>

    <P>RECIPE NOTES</P>
    <P><strong>Note:</strong> If your pan is not big enough to fit both the bread slices and rounds at the same time, toast the rounds separately in the pan after the eggs come out, about 40 seconds per side over medium-low heat.</P>
