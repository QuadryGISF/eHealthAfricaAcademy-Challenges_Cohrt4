    <h1>Learn</h1>
    <p>As you traverse the length and breadth of the globe<br>
        notice how humankind try to do simply amazing things<br>
        in order to derive satisfaction from those things<br>
        that is where learning comes into play.<br>
    </p>

    </p>Learn whatever you want<br>
        especially things that will make you<br>
        when people move from grass to grace; they have learnt something in between<br>
        when someone goes from zero to hero; he has learnt something in between<br>
        from the quietness of space to the darkness of deep ocean<br>
        learning never ends.<br>
    </p>
        
    <p> As a rule of thumb<br>
        learn, unlearn and relearn.
    </p>
