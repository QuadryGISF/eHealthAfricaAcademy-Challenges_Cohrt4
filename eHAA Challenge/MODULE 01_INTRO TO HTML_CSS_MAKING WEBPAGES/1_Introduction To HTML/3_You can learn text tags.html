        <strong>Nobody’s born <em>smart</em></strong>. We all start at 0. Can’t talk, can’t walk, certainly can’t do algebra.<br>
        Adding, reading, writing, riding a bike. <strong>Nobody’s good at <em>anything</em> at first.<br></strong>
        There was a time when Einstein couldn’t count to 10.<br>
        And Shakespeare had to learn his ABCs just like the rest of us.<br>
        <strong>Thankfully, <em>we are born to learn</em>.<br></strong>
        Slowly. Surely. You stumble, slip, crawl, fall and fail and fall.<br>
        Frustrating. Confusing. Trying. Struggling.<br>
        Until one day, you walk.<br>
        <em>foot in front of the other. One idea on top of the next</em>.<br>
        Each wrong answer making your brain a little bit stronger.<br>
        Failing is just another word for growing. And you keep going.<br>
        <strong>This. is. learning.</strong><br>
        <em>It’s not that you don’t get it</em>. <br>
        <em>You just don’t get it, <strong>yet</strong></em>.
        Because the most beautiful, complex concepts in the whole universe<br>
        are built on basic ideas that anyone, anywhere can understand.<br>
        <strong>whoever you are, wherever you are</strong> .<br>
        </p>
        <p>
        You only have to <strong>know one thing:<br></strong>
        <strong>You can learn <em>anything</em></strong>
